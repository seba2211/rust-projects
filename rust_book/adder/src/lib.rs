// 11.2 Controlling How Tests are Run

/*
* # Running Tests in Parallel or Consecutively
* If you donâ€™t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained control over the number of threads used,
* you can send the --test-threads flag and the number of threads you want to use to the test binary
*
    cargo test -- --test-threads=1

* # Showing Function Output
* If we want to see printed values for passing tests as well, 
* we can tell Rust to also show the output of successful tests at the end with --show-output
*
    cargo test -- --show-output

* # Running a Subset of Tests by Name
* 
    cargo test <test_name>

* Without using <>
* # Ignoring Some Tests Unless Specifically Requested
* After #[test] we add the #[ignore] line to the test we want to exclude
*
*    #[test]
*    #[ignore]
*    fn expensive_test() {
*    // code that takes an hour to run
*    }
*
* If we want to run only the ignored tests, we can use 
* 
    cargo test -- --ignored
*
